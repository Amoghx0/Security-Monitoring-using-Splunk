## Objective

To gain hands-on experience in using Splunk for real-time security monitoring, threat detection, and incident response by collecting, indexing, and analyzing machine data from various sources.

### Skills learned
- Understanding Splunk components (Indexer, Search Head, Forwarder) and how they interact in a security monitoring environment.
- Ingesting logs from multiple sources including Windows, Linux etc. 
- Designing interactive dashboards and setting up real-time alerts for security events.
- Analysing network logs such as DNS, SSH, HTTP and Zeek connection logs.

## Conclusion

Working with Splunk provided a solid foundation in security monitoring and SIEM operations. I gained practical experience in detecting and responding to potential security incidents, building use cases, and creating actionable dashboards and alerts. This experience enhanced my understanding of how organizations use data-driven approaches to protect their environments and respond to threats in real-time.
